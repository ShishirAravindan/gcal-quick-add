# Feature Backlog

- [x] keyboard shortcuts (like ctrl/cmd + enter to enter/create event)
- [x] feature refactor: model choice overhaul
  - make gemini model default instead of ollama.
  - the model status indicator doesn't update appropriately. 
- [x] Support for recurring events
  - the prompt indicates how to do this but maybe because this is optional i don't think it registers properly.
  - Here's specifically the expected data format:

    3.8.5.3.  Recurrence Rule

   Property Name:  RRULE

   Purpose:  This property defines a rule or repeating pattern for
      recurring events, to-dos, journal entries, or time zone
      definitions.

   Value Type:  RECUR

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified in recurring "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", and "VJOURNAL" calendar components as well as in the
      "STANDARD" and "DAYLIGHT" sub-components of the "VTIMEZONE"
      calendar component, but it SHOULD NOT be specified more than once.
      The recurrence set generated with multiple "RRULE" properties is
      undefined.

   Description:  The recurrence rule, if specified, is used in computing
      the recurrence set.  The recurrence set is the complete set of
      recurrence instances for a calendar component.  The recurrence set
      is generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along
      with the "RRULE", "RDATE", and "EXDATE" properties contained
      within the recurring component.  The "DTSTART" property defines
      the first instance in the recurrence set.  The "DTSTART" property
      value SHOULD be synchronized with the recurrence rule, if
      specified.  The recurrence set generated with a "DTSTART" property
      value not synchronized with the recurrence rule is undefined.  The
      final recurrence set is generated by gathering all of the start
      DATE-TIME values generated by any of the specified "RRULE" and
      "RDATE" properties, and then excluding any start DATE-TIME values
      specified by "EXDATE" properties.  This implies that start DATE-
      TIME values specified by "EXDATE" properties take precedence over
      those specified by inclusion properties (i.e., "RDATE" and
      "RRULE").  Where duplicate instances are generated by the "RRULE"
